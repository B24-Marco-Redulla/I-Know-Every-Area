### Project Feedback
**Choose you DON'T KNOW (for objectivity), but might be interested in your project and demo your program. Indicate the following.**

2.  I find the idea behind the website interesting. The website design actually kinda feels like something IKEA would make and, to me, is pretty good. Some things could be cleaned up for sure, but the functionality is there and it seems to be good overall so congrats I guess.

3. I'm honestly happy with what we've done with this project. Doing the project itself was stressful, but i still had some fun. Recalling lessons about css and html was fun for me as it was one of my favorite cs courses. Overall, similar to what the feedback said, we could've done some things better, but im proud of the project anyways.

4. I'm extremely greatful for having a laptop, having internet, having functional eyes, block c, opal 2024, my other friends, my parents, my brothers, and the samsung lab for having aircon.

2. The website design is good and encapsulates the vibe of IKEA really well. It almost feels like it‚Äôs an official pathfinder released by the showroom company itself. Very interactive interface and straightforward buttons that give you what you want and the layout of the website seems to be organized properly. Overall, I find the website really nice with good graphics without sacrificing its functionality.

3. The project was tedious but fun. Having the code work just brings a sense of elation (especially on the first try). It was fun to relearn some stuff in cs like html and css. I‚Äôm generally happy with the results of the website and thankful for my group who kinda carried.

4. I'm grateful that I somewhat learned some stuff in the classes. I‚Äôm not really that great at cs but the classes were enjoyable and interesting.

2. I like the user interface as it is interactive and really fun to play around with. Additionally, I enjoy organizing things, but I enjoy it more when the program does it for me.

2. The website has a professional feel, and all of its features are organized. I like how there are many pictures, which are very helpful. Finally, I think there should be bonus points because it's IKEA.

3. Considering that my interviewees were two grade 8 students I randomly approached in the library, it was a challenge getting them to understand why some parts of the application were there, such as the minimum spanning tree. However, thanks to the pictures and small injections of humor throughout the About and Contact pages, I was able to keep their attention for long enough. I admit that there are still parts that can be cleaned up, but all in all I'm happy about how the whole project turned out. 
As a researcher, measuring IKEA for the graph seemed like an insurmountable task because of the failing GPS signal inside the store. Despite this, I was able to overcome it with the help of my groupmates and a new unit of measurement (Marco feet). While touring IKEA, I also witnessed firsthand something Sir Vlad taught us in Econ: stores plan their layouts specifically to entice you to stay inside longer and potentially buy more. Also, as a documenter, I learned more about how to manage  and evaluate large-scale projects such as these.

4. Firstly, I'm grateful for Marco Redulla, who has been singlehandedly carrying my CS grade for an entire school year. Second, I would like to thank my parents for buying me a working laptop after the battery of my old one basically disintegrated. Third, I would like to thank Christian, Nina and Yohance for putting up with me. Sir Roy has also been a great help in dealing with the project. Finally, special thanks are in order to Benji's group for ordering everyone McDo.

2. Very cluttered, and I might get more lost looking at your website than if I was going through the IKEA myself. üò¶

3. I completely agree with everything she said. Although a lot of the functionality is there, I think the project could be cleaned up in a lot of areas. Specifically, I think it could be a bit confusing to anybody that was not working on the project, because things like "topological sort" do not mean anything to them. But overall, considering Marco and I had forgotten a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript going into this, we were able to do OK, and this project was a good refresher on these very core programming languages.

4. Very grateful for my band, my brother, mother, father, Block C, and all my teachers this year. lessthan3+1

1. N/A (Gave it to other groupmates to fulfill as I had to take over for other tasks)

2. N/A

3. For me, the project was really stressful as I had a lot of things to manage. Being the "group leader" isn't really easy and we even had to let go of one of our groupmates. While I may think that, I will not deny that this is one of my favorite experiences in CS5. I've had the opportunity to create web apps before for competitions, but this is the first time that I have handled both the front end and the back end. Relearning HTML and CSS was a very daunting task which required me to ask online multiple times for simple things like centering div elements as I'm not really good at graphics design. I'm somewhat sad that not everyone was able to contribute to the code as I believe that this is a really fun activity and that everyone should at least learn the basics of webdev. Overall, I'm very happy with what we've created. It might not be the best, but it's ours and thats what matters the most.

4. In general, I'm grateful for all the new lessons that have been taught to us over the span of the school year. I've also made a lot of new friends along the way

Hi sir! Thanks for teaching us this school year. Classes had just a right mix of fun and learning. Sadly there's no CS6 class so I won't be doing that much coding anymore. I hope that you'll meet even more energetic and crazy students :)
